# Substr3am

Substr3am is a python tool inspired by [subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute) and [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) designed to generate a list of potential subdomains using the [certstream](https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-python) service. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for their lists by connecting to the certstream firehose, watching for real subdomains, and adding them to a list for use with the above tools.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/nexxai/Substr3am.git
```

## Recommended Python Version:

Substr3am currently supports **Python 3**.  Stop using **Python 2**.  I suck at Python and even I know that.

* The recommended version for Python 3 is **3.8.x**

NOTE: There is currently an issue with a dependency and Python v3.9 so do not upgrade to that version for now as you will receive websockets errors until the dependency is updated.

## Dependencies:

Substr3am depends on the `certstream`, `argparse`, `tldextract`, and `sqlalchemy` python modules.

These dependencies can be installed using the requirements file:

- Installation on Windows:
```
c:\python\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Installation on Linux / MacOS:
```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Short Form               | Long Form                      | Description
------------------------ | ------------------------------ |-------------
`./Substr3am`              |                                | Start collecting subdomains and write them to the subdomains.db sqlite DB
`./Substr3am -f [DOMAINS]` | `./Substr3am --filter [DOMAINS]` | A space-separated list of domain names to filter for (e.g. 'google.com' or 'tesco.co.uk tesco.com harrods.com').  *BE PATIENT* - if you are filtering by domain(s), there will only be activity when new certs are issued so just let it run and it'll announce when it sees any new ones.
`./Substr3am -d`           | `./Substr3am --dump`             | Dump the list of collected subdomains to names.txt

### Examples

* To only return results for a particular list of domains

```python3 Substr3am.py -f google.com google.cn microsoft.com uber.com```

* To export your collected subdomains from the sqlite DB to a file called 'names.txt

```python3 Substr3am.py -d```
